This repo is the second of 4 repos that introduce our work. It provides utilities to train semantic segmentation models, using a HRNet-W48 or PSPNet backbone, sufficient to train a winning entry on the [WildDash](https://wilddash.cc/benchmark/summary_tbl?hc=semantic_rob) benchmark.

- [` mseg-api`](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api): utilities to download the MSeg dataset, prepare the data on disk in a unified taxonomy, on-the-fly mapping to a unified taxonomy during training.

Two additional repos will be introduced in June 2020:
- `mseg-panoptic`: provides Panoptic-FPN and Mask-RCNN training, based on Detectron2
- `mseg-mturk`: provides utilities to perform large-scale Mechanical Turk re-labeling

### Dependencies

Install the `mseg` model from [`mseg-api`](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api)

### Install the MSeg-Semantic module:

* `mseg_semantic` can be installed as a python package using

        pip install -e /path_to_root_directory_of_the_repo/

Make sure that you can run `import mseg_semantic` in python, and you are good to go!


## MSeg Pre-trained Models

Each model is 528 MB in size. We provide download links and multi-scale testing results below:

## Inference: Using our pre-trained models

We show how to perform inference here [in our Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ctyBEf74uA-7R8sidi026OvNb4WlKkG1?usp=sharing).

Multi-scale inference greatly improves the smoothness of predictions, therefore our demos scripts use multi-scale config by default. While we train at 1080p, our predictions are often visually better when we feed in test images at 360p resolution.

If you have video input, and you would like to make predictions on each frame in the universal taxonomy, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/video.mp4
```
If you have a set of images in a directory, and you would like to make a prediction in the universal taxonomy for each image, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/directory
```

If you have as input a single image, and you would like to make a prediction in the universal taxonomy, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/image
```

Now, run our demo script:
```
model_name=mseg-3m
model_path=/path/to/downloaded/model/from/google/drive
config=mseg_semantic/config/test/default_config_360.yaml
python -u mseg_semantic/tool/universal_demo.py \
  --config=${config} model_name ${model_name} model_path ${model_path} input_file ${input_file}
```

If you would like to make predictions in a specific dataset's taxonomy, e.g. Cityscapes, for the RVC Challenge, please run:
``` (will be added) ```

Note that the output number of classes for 7 of the models listed above will be identical (194 classes). These are the models that represent a single training dataset's performance -- *ADE20K (1M), BDD (1M), Cityscapes (1M ), COCO (1M), IDD (1M), Mapillary (1M), SUN RGB-D (1M)*. When we train a baseline model on a single dataset, we train it in the universal taxonomy (w/ 194 classes). If we did not do so, we would need to specify 7*6=42 mappings (which would be unbelievably tedious and also fairly redundant) since we measure each's performance according to zero-shot cross-dataset generalization -- 7 training datasets with their own taxonomy, and each would need its own mapping to each of the 6 test sets. 

By training each baseline *that is trained on a single training dataset* within the universal taxonomy, we are able to specify just 7+6=13 mappings in [this table](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api/blob/master/mseg/class_remapping_files/MSeg_master.tsv) (each training dataset's taxonomy->universal taxonomy, and then universal taxonomy to each test dataset).

**WildDash has no training set, so an "oracle" model cannot be trained.


## Experiment Settings
We use the [HRNetV2-W48](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04514.pdf) architecture. All images are resized to 1080p (shorter size=1080) at training time before a crop is taken.

 We run inference with the shorter side of each test image at three resolutions (360p, 720p, 1080p), and take the max among these 3 possible resolutions. Note that in the original [semseg](https://github.com/hszhao/semseg) repo, the author specifies the longer side of an image, whereas we specify the shorter side. Batch size is set to 35.

We generally follow the recommendations of [Zhao et al.](https://github.com/hszhao/semseg): Our data augmentation consists of random scaling in the range [0.5,2.0], random rotation in the range [-10,10] degrees. We use SGD with momentum 0.9, weight decay of 1e-4. We use a polynomial learning rate with power 0.9. Base learning rate is set to 1e-2. An auxiliary cross-entropy (CE) loss is added to intermediate activations, a linear combination with weight 0.4. In our data, we use 255 as an ignore/unlabeled flag for the CE loss. We use Pytorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) package for multiprocessing, with the NCCL backend. We use apex opt_level: 'O0' and use a crop size of 713x713, with synchronized BN.

## Training Instructions

Download the HRNet Backbone Model [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aus8VCZ_C_33dKvqI6pBZlifgJk) from the original authors' OneDrive. We use 8 Quadro RTX 6000 cards, each w/ 24 GB of RAM, for training.
