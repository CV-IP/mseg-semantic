This repo is the second of 4 repos that introduce our work. It provides utilities to train semantic segmentation models, using a HRNet-W48 or PSPNet backbone, sufficient to train a winning entry on the [WildDash](https://wilddash.cc/benchmark/summary_tbl?hc=semantic_rob) benchmark).

- [` mseg-api`](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api): utilities to download the MSeg dataset, prepare the data on disk in a unified taxonomy, on-the-fly mapping to a unified taxonomy during training.

Two additional repos will be introduced in June 2020:
- `mseg-panoptic`: provides Panoptic-FPN and Mask-RCNN training, based on Detectron2
- `mseg-mturk`: provides utilities to perform large-scale Mechanical Turk re-labeling

### Dependencies

Install the `mseg` model from [`mseg-api`](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api)

### Install the MSeg-Semantic module:

* `mseg_semantic` can be installed as a python package using

        pip install -e /path_to_root_directory_of_the_repo/

Make sure that you can run `import mseg_semantic` in python, and you are good to go!


## MSeg Pre-trained Models

Each model is 528 MB in size. We provide download links and multi-scale testing results below:

## Inference: Using our pre-trained models

Multi-scale inference greatly improves the smoothness of predictions, therefore our demos scripts use multi-scale config by default. While we train at 1080p, our predictions are often visually better when we feed in test images at 360p resolution.

If you have video input, and you would like to make predictions on each frame in the universal taxonomy, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/video.mp4
```
If you have a set of images in a directory, and you would like to make a prediction in the universal taxonomy for each image, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/directory
```

If you have as input a single image, and you would like to make a prediction in the universal taxonomy, please set:
```
input_file=/path/to/my/image
```

Now, run our demo script:
```
model_name=mseg-3m
model_path=/path/to/downloaded/model/from/google/drive
config=mseg_semantic/config/test/default_config_360.yaml
python -u mseg_semantic/tool/universal_demo.py \
  --config=${config} model_name ${model_name} model_path ${model_path} input_file ${input_file}
```

If you would like to make predictions in a specific dataset's taxonomy, e.g. Cityscapes, for the RVC Challenge, please run:
``` (will be added) ```

## Testing a Model Trained in the Universal Taxonomy

To compute mIoU scores on a particular dataset, run the following:
```
python mseg_semantic/tool/test_universal_tax.py --config=mseg_semantic/config/test/default_config_360.yaml dataset camvid-11
```

## Testing a Model Trained in the Oracle Taxonomy

"Oracle" models are trained in a test dataset's taxonomy, on its train splt. To compute mIoU scores on the test dataset's val or test set, please run the following:
```
python mseg_semantic/tool/test_oracle_tax.py
```

Note that the output number of classes for 7 of the models listed above will be identical (194 classes). These are the models that represent a single training dataset's performance -- *ADE20K (1M), BDD (1M), Cityscapes (1M ), COCO (1M), IDD (1M), Mapillary (1M), SUN RGB-D (1M)*. When we train a baseline model on a single dataset, we train it in the universal taxonomy (w/ 194 classes). If we did not do so, we would need to specify 7*6=42 mappings (which would be unbelievably tedious and also fairly redundant) since we measure each's performance according to zero-shot cross-dataset generalization -- 7 training datasets with their own taxonomy, and each would need its own mapping to each of the 6 test sets. 

By training each baseline *that is trained on a single training dataset* within the universal taxonomy, we are able to specify just 7+6=13 mappings in [this table](https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api/blob/master/mseg/class_remapping_files/MSeg_master.tsv) (each training dataset's taxonomy->universal taxonomy, and then universal taxonomy to each test dataset).

**WildDash has no training set, so an "oracle" model cannot be trained.


## Experiment Settings
We use an HRNet-W48 backbone, we generally follow the recommendations of [Zhao et al.](https://github.com/hszhao/semseg): We use a ResNet50 or ResNet101 backbone, with a crop size of 713x713, with synchronized BN. All images are resized to 1080p at training time before a crop is taken.

Our data augmentation consists of random scaling in the range [0.5,2.0], random rotation in the range [-10,10] degrees. We use SGD with momentum 0.9, weight decay of 1e-4. We use a polynomial learning rate with power 0.9. Base learning rate is set to 1e-2. An auxiliary cross-entropy (CE) loss is added to intermediate activations, a linear combination with weight 0.4. In our data, we use 255 as an ignore/unlabeled flag for the CE loss. Logits are upsampled by a factor is 8 ("zoom factor") to match original label map resolution for loss calculation.

We use Pytorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) package for multiprocessing, with the NCCL backend. Zhao et al. recommend a training batch size of 16, with different number of epochs per dataset (ADE20k: 200, Cityscapes: 200, Camvid: 100, VOC2012: 50). For inference, we use a multi-scale accumulation of probabilities: [0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75]. Base size (ADE20K: 512, Camvid: 512, Cityscapes: 2048, VOC: 512) roughly equivalent to the average longer side of an image.

We use apex opt_level: 'O0'

For HRNet, we follow the [original authors' suggestions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04514.pdf): a learning rate of 0.01, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 5e-4. As above, we use a polynomial learning rate with power 0.9. Batch size is set to...
